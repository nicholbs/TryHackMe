-------------------------------------------------------------------
**Abstract**  

This report outlines weaknesses exposed in excessive user rights on a windows 2000 computer, and subsequently the lack of active directory domain services configuration.  
Remote attacker was enabled access through ethernalBlue, buffer overflow attack and lack of security configurations.  
Means and meassures of attacks and procedures for recovery are described in details.

1. Purpose of report  
--------------------
The report outlines how excessive user rights constitute foothold
