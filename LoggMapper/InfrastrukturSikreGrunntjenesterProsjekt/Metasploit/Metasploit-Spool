Description:
  This module exploits a buffer overflow in the header parsing of 
  icecast versions 2.0.1 and earlier, discovered by Luigi Auriemma. 
  Sending 32 HTTP headers will cause a write one past the end of a 
  pointer array. On win32 this happens to overwrite the saved 
  instruction pointer, and on linux (depending on compiler, etc) this 
  seems to generally overwrite nothing crucial (read not exploitable). 
  This exploit uses ExitThread(), this will leave icecast thinking the 
  thread is still in use, and the thread counter won't be decremented. 
  This means for each time your payload exits, the counter will be 
  left incremented, and eventually the threadpool limit will be maxed. 
  So you can multihit, but only till you fill the threadpool.
