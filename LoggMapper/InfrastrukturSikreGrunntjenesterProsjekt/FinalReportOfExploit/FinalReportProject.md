1.Purpose of report  
--------------------
The windows infrastructure component Active directory Certificate Services will be proven vulnerable to exessive user rights. 

Report outlines how excessive user rights constitute foothold for attackers to exploit a windows infrastructure.  
Readers will alltogether learn the importance of exercising appropriate group policies for users.  
Furthermore, attackers methodology is bestoved focus to demonstrate the mentality needed  
from administrator when implementing security systems in their network.  

Exploits explored in this report are all available in the metasploit framework.  
Moreover, Metasploit consists of scripts, modules, interfaces and libraries assembled together into a single framework.  
The framework serves as an ease of access tool for penetration testing networks, proficiency in computer systems is not required.  
This report will only use tools obtainable through metasploit.  
With this in mind, one could argue that any user pose a security threat and should be given rights accordingly.  

2.Exploited vulnerability 
=======================  

2.1 Current infrastructure and services  
---------------------------------------  
The scenario consists of a radio streaming business.  
Local clients use the application Icecast for publishing their audio online.
Remote listeners connects to locally hosted web addresses, typically on a web browser.
Icecast can be applied to most unix and windows opperating systems, and it is notewhorty that the application does not produce audio.  
  
Third party software is necessary to feed sound into Icecast. Supplementary software for audio feed is accessible on any operating system.  
Consequently exploiting Icecast affects all broadcasters in our scenario, there are no limitations based on operating systems.  

The infrastructure itself reflects a medium sized business in size and consists of hosts connected into a windows domain with active directory domain services.  
It is notewhorty that neither size or type of computer is a determining factor for this scenario seing as any client or server running Icecast is affected.  
Subsequently, future examples of the infrastructure revolve around a single host.  

 2.1 Buffer overflow
 -------------------
Specifically, Icecast version 2.0.1 and earlier installements are vulnerable to buffer overflow.  
Buffer overflow is a central concept to avoid when creating sturdy and reliable code.
Programs that run without proper measurements against overflowing buffers from user input can result in execution of malicious code on hosts.
In other words, explaining the concept of buffer overflow is vital for understanding the ensuing vulnerabilities.
After all, understanding the problem is essential before applying solutions.  

>"No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it." -Albert Einstein  

Imagine pouring water into a glass, it soon reaches the brim. The glass is entirely full and has reached its limits.
Then pour some additional water and water overflows.  
In a similar fashion programs without proper boundaries can overflow buffers.  
Buffers are an allocated memory block of specified lenght.  
Superceeding the manageable amount of data results in extra data overwriting critical values. 

To understand the concept of buffer overflow, following chapters makes an attempt at explaining:
1. Usage of buffers in coding
2. Memory addresses spaces.
3. Leak in memory

*Usage of buffers in coding*  
The regularity of buffer overflow differ from programming languages and the environment code is written in.  
Programs written in C are often associated with buffer overflow.  
Games tends to be developed with languages of similar features as they offers faster compiling time and execution with optimization.  
Furthermore values on security and reliability in such environments are often sacrificed for speed.  
Input from users is gathered with functions such as scanf, gets and strcpy.  
The less boundary checking, the more compiling speed.  
No matter the circumstances, absence of bounds-checking ultimately results in buffer overflow.  

All programs that ask for input has some way or form of buffer tied into the process. 
Users can be prompted to input their names. Behind the scenes the program was made with the expectation that no name contains more than 20 characters.  
Writing "John Smith" meets the boundaries for the program and it is able to run along successfully.  
Write "John Smithhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" and suddenly the buffer has overflown with all extra "h" overwriting the next memory address.

*Memory address spaces*  
Programs are given access to memory during runtime and becomes a process.  
The memory can be viewed as blocks, within are address spaces stacked together to form the block.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/BufferOverflowExplanation/Allocated%20memory.PNG" width="400" height="230">  

Essentially, code is compiled from human programming language into machine code and mapped into each address space.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/BufferOverflowExplanation/Address%20space.PNG" width="400" height="230">  

Processes load addresses to serve a function inside the program.  
To conclude, memory adress is assigned to a process and contains code to be loaded and run by programs.  

*Leak in memory*  
Programs use functions to achieve tasks and require some form of computing handled by the CPU.  
The address of memory to be computed is sent to the CPU and considered instructions.  
There are different types of storage for instruction in the CPU called registers.  
To remain on topic, only the vulnerability concept will be explained and not the structure of registers.  

The CPU handles an instruction at a time, in which it uses pointers to deliminate which instruction to be handled in order. 
Extended Stack pointer (ESP) keeps track of what memory address is the current instruction.  
Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) keeps track of what memory address is the succedding instruction.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/BufferOverflowExplanation/Instructions.PNG" width="400" height="230">  

Conclusively, we are able to address the vulnerability being exploited, namely overwriting the pointed address.  
For example, the current instruction pointed by the ESP is a buffer.
The buffer was an allocated space for input from user to be contained.  
User exceeds the boundaries with its input and overflows into next address space, which overwrites the address pointed by EIP.  
In extent, the user has created a new pointed address which resulted on seperate code being run and executed.

Overwriting could lead to processes loading malicious code, some opens powershell and execute cmdlets.  

The general explanation for buffer overflow applies to several exploits. This report has emphasis on its usage thowards Icecast.

3.Attack  
========
Cybersecurity is a tug of war between attackers and defender.  
Both sides has respective weaknesses and strenghts and the element of surprise is perhaps the attackers foremost advantage.  
In the scenario at hand there are multiple possibilities for attackers to gain knowledge about the broadcasting service's network.  
The broadcasting service is a business and naturally advertise their services on the internet.    
Another method for finding potential targets is picking an ISP and carry out a domain based search to determine their associated IP address block. 
This is the auxilliary phase in which attackers gain knowledge prior to directly exploiting vulnerabilities.  

Tools and methods presented are opensource and easily available for users without hacking background. 

3.1 Recon/Auxilliary  
--------------------
Nmap is a commonly used network mapping tool. There are numerous functionalities inside nmap which is used to discover hosts and affiliated services.  
Network packaged are sent and the returning answers, or lack of, are used to detemine what circumstances produce the packages received on the target host.  
Furthermore, Nmap generate reports based on percentage for possible conditions and environments the scanned host are in.  
In regards to retaining the element of surprise, attackers scan the target's network and gradually increasing the leverage used behind each sweep.  
For example TCP packages can initially be sent as SYN messages which only completes half of the TCP handshake. Target will answer with reset as it has no knowledge of the connection and usually do not logg the occurrence.   
[Nmap-SYN-Scan](https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/nmap-scans/nmap-SynScan)  

It is notewhorty that routers and hosts usually are configured to not answer unestablished connections.  
The leverage on attacks increases as the "-A" option is flagged and nmap performs an aggressive scanning of the target.  
Experienced attackers will refrain from using predefined scripts and methods, despite this our report illustrates that any user can be capable of launching such attacks.  
[Nmap-Agressive-Scan](https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/nmap-scans/nmap-AggressiveScan)  
[Nmap-Vulnerability-Scan](https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/nmap-scans/nmap-VulnScan.PNG)  

Nmap reports that the target is likely vulnerable to ms-17_010, Namely the vulnerability EternalBlue used in WannaCry.  
In addition, nmap was also able to conclude that port 8000 is associated with Icecast services.  
Either exploit serves as an entry point, and the focus remains on exploiting Icecast.

3.2 Gain Access  
---------------  
Metasploit is a framework to penetration test networks. For instance, Metasploit comes with nmap and a vast amount of modules to run against targets. The framework can be summarized with the following model provided by [Varonis blogg post](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-metasploit/)  

<img src="https://blogvaronis2.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/metasploit-guide-benefits.png" width="420" height="300">  

 
Metasploit uses same script as first reported by [Luigi Auriemma](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/568) and is runnable after defining RHOST parameter to targeted host.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/Metasploit/IcecastExploitRun.PNG" width="620" height="150">  

Icecast script can be summarized into four stages:  
1. Use buffer overflow and point to malicious code.  
2. Malicious code installs Netcat or similar software on remote target meanwhile a local listener awaits connection from target.
3. Netcat establishes TCP session with attacker from target.
4. Newly created session is established with meterpreter shell.  

Buffer overflow as explained previously is used to execute malicious code which installs Netcat.  
Netcat attemps to initiate TCP connection back to attacker, in our case the attacker has a listener on port 4444.  
Session is established and created with a meterpreter payload. Meterpreter is injected into the targets memory and serves the attacker as a "shell" which can load extensions from Metasploit.  
Meterpreter is out of scope for this report. Nevertheless, meterpreter residing in memory is important as nothing is written to disks and therefore becomes difficult to trace by defenders.  

3.3 Escalate  
------------  
Meterpreter and other payloads in target's memory have corresponding rights to the processes they reside in.  
The ultimate goal for an attacker is achieving administrative rights, in regards to meterpreter that comes with migrating into processes run by an administrator.  
Another aspect of migrating comes from the possibility of loosing access to target host if the process meterpreter inhabit is terminated, connection between attacker and target ceases.
Migrating to a process which is stable and which elevates rights is therefore vital for the attacker.  
The targeted network has throughout this exercise posessed little to none security measures prohibiting unwanted users access.  
In spite of this, attacker is prohibited from migrating prosesses and entering files in view of active directory certificate services and Windows UAC (User account Control) requiring authentication.  

Exploits revealed thus far on the radio network is Icecast and EternalBlue. Updated software is available to hinder buffer overflow for Icecast, and SMBv1 protocol is outdated which enables EternalBlue attacks.  
Considering that neither exploits should have been accessible for the attacker, it may be concluded that the implementation of active directory right management services and group policies was flawed.  
To encapsulate the aforementioned facts into the running theme of this report, the component of windows infrastructe that is made vulnerable is certificate and authentication servises. 

Authentication is generally handled in two manners from an attackers standpoint. To illustrate one could imagine a locked door blocking entrance into a house. Depending on the sturdiness and strenght that the door comprise of, with enough brute force and attemts an attacker would manage to knock it down. Methods that apply brute force are noisy and can develop into other problems.  
Prefferably, an attacker want to remain undetected and circumvent the door altogether through a window.  
Continuing from the attacker's perspective, the locked door obstructiong further access into the system is UAC prohibiting programs from tasks related to system changes.  
Essentially, processes are tagged with a UAC flag that require authentication to turn off. The current meterpreter session has equivalent rights to the process holder, namely "Dark", and brute forcing with every bit of information made available through the user is always an option.  
Despite this, there are modules in Metasploit for bypassing UAC impeded processes.
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/Metasploit/Escalating.PNG" width="650" height="290">  

Newly created shell has UAC flag turned off and allows meterpreter to migrate into another process. Processes that are stable and inherit elevated rights have not been difficult to discover while researching for this project.   
In fact, printing involves a process called "spoolsv" which interacts with printers and often maintain elevated rights.  

3.4 Post-Exploitation and looting  
---------------------------------  

Host is at this point fully compromised and as attackers have migrated into a process of "NT AUTHORITY".  
Comparatively, administrator accounts are below "NT AUTHORITY" in privilege.  
Post modules in Metasploit are applied to host and retrieves all of its credentials rendering certification of users futile.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/Metasploit/Creds_all.PNG" width="600" height="500">  
   
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/Metasploit/Hashdump.PNG" width="600" height="80">  

The host is also converted into a monitoring device for the attacker as access to camera, audio devices, and screen can record its near surroundings.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/FinalReportOfExploit/ScreenshotOfTarget.jpeg" width="340" height="320">  

In spite of the circumstances, the remaining network is not necessarily breached. Active directory can still have restraints between different nodes in network.  
For example kerberos is part of authenticating both users and computers with its ticket granting services. 
ALthough the report could continue with leverage on modules inside Metasploit for obtaining a "Golden Ticket", the purpose of the report has been achieved.

Excessive user rights have been proven to constitute foothold for attackers to exploit a windows infrastructure. 
Foremost, excessive user privilege reflect a flawn implementation of active directory right management services and group policies which enabled attacker to exploit Icecast and possibly EternalBlue.  
As a consequence of the exploitable services, active directory certificate services and other windows authentication components became vulnerable. 



4.Recovery procedures 
=====================
Clients that host software services to the internet should be monitored carefully.
This topic covers procedures for recovering a system breached with the Icecast vulnerability.  

4.1 Identify the problem  
------------------------
Symptoms of a system breached through Icecast vulnerabilities can be found in:
1. Microsoft error message (pop up windows)
2. Microsoft Eventviewer
3. Netcat

Icecast will forcefully close on the client which is streaming.  
The generated pop upp error message describes Icecast encountering a problem.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/FinalReportOfExploit/Icecast%20error%20message.PNG" width="400" height="230">  
host would need to be physically present to view such an error.  
Furthermore, there are small margins for the breach being reported before attacker has hidden his presence.  

Microsoft Eventviewer is far more likely to be noticed by defenders.  
<img src="https://github.com/nicholbs/TryHackMe/blob/master/LoggMapper/InfrastrukturSikreGrunntjenesterProsjekt/FinalReportOfExploit/Microsoft%20Eventviewer.PNG" width="300" height="300">  

Breached hosts can be recognized with traces of netcat.  
Netcat is shortly put a software able to establish network UDP and TCP connections.  
Signes of an attacker using this software is a capturing packets with the address of pages to download netcat.  
Another sign is physical instances of netcat listeners on host.  
For instance the process can be viewed through task manager and Eventviewer.  

4.2 Being rooted  
----------------
Contain the host and prefferably the whole network unavailable from internet. Involve law enforcement and document the actions that led to the compromised system being discovered.
Duplicate hard drives on exposed systems and assemble them together as evidence.  
Deliver the physical evidence in addition to all documentation of the accident to forensic analysis. It is vital that access to the evidence has been limited before changing custody.  

Ensuing reports in this scenario indicate that the attacker has gained admin or root privilege.  
Being rooted means the attacker is capable of planting backdoors to regain control at a later time, a full system recovery is necessary. 
In other words, achieving full certainy that a system is not under influence of others call for rebuilding at the operating system level.  


4.3 Recover control  
-------------------
The vulnerabilities explored in this report all stem from users having excessive rights and privileges.  
Restricting users and computers through group policies or other rule enforcing systems is advised.  
Administration of large enterprises and sophisticated networks are advised to follow the hereinafter ruleset:   
Foremost, vulnerabilities on the software itself require administration off allowed applications to run on hosts.  
Secondly, users should be prohibited from downloading software or limited to a secure selection.  
Internet access moderated through internal and external gateway's firewall.  
Antivirues software, keep in mind that not every virus is detectable or handable even by antivirus software. For example viruses have adapted to attack through staying in volatile memory which does not produce writing to files and is less detectable.  

4.4 Prospects of active directory
